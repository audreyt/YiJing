=head1 DESCRIPTION

# XXX

=head2 Judgment

    節。亨。苦節不可貞。

Harsh censorship can never last long.

=head2 Interpretation

    彖曰：節，亨，剛柔分，而剛得中。苦節不可貞，其道窮也。
          說以行險，當位以節，中正以通。天地節而四時成，
	  節以制度，不傷財，不害民。

Censorship is funny; it splits the rigid people from flexible folks, and
tries to satisfy the rigid ones. Draconian censorships will not bring
anybody good, because their days are coming to an end.

It's a sensitive topic; the government officials should take care, and
choose the middle path.  Like how heaven and earth moderates the four
seasons, censorship systems should be balanced, and never damage
business or hurt civil liberty.

Regulations should be used to promote balance
