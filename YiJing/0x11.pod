=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Beware: There is only a thin line between a crawler and a worm!"

=head2 Judgment

    蠱。元。亨。利涉大川。先甲三日。后甲三日。

Web crawler: Nice and fun.  Suitable to sift in the great Data Flow.
Test run for three days before sending it out; analyze the data for
three days before sending it out again.

=head2 Interpretation

    彖曰。蠱。剛上而柔下。巽而止。
	  蠱。元亨。而天下治也。利涉大川。往有事也。
	  先甲三日。后甲三日。終則有始。天行也。

This hexagram is emblematic of the trouble that you would face in
writing or managing a web crawler: the program has to strike out on its
own and unobtrusively sift great gobs of data in any number of messy
formats.

It needs testing and retesting, planning and monitoring. It has to
follow old standards and accept new ones, and tolerate sites that don't
follow standards at all. To do its work, the web crawler has to get as
much data from as many sites as it can, without bothering any webmasters
in the process.

It has to be efficient, but deliberate. It is a matter of contradictory
goals -- a situation that comes up in all sorts of systems besides web
crawlers.

=head2 Image
